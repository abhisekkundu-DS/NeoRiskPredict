## 📘 Overview

**NeoRiskPredict** is an AI-based system designed to predict the **health risk level of newborn babies** during their initial hours of life.  
The goal is to assist healthcare professionals by providing **early warnings** about potential neonatal complications, enabling timely interventions and improving survival rates.

This project uses **deep learning models (LSTM and MLP)** trained on perinatal, maternal, and neonatal data to estimate the likelihood of health risks such as respiratory distress, infections, and other complications.
